SPECIFICATION
  

OVERVIEW

A simple phone book whose entries consist of a name and a 
phone number.  The user can browse the phone book, search for 
an entry, and add, edit and delete entries.  


DETAILS

The phone book displays a single entry, which consists of a 
name and a phone number on separate line.  Below the entry, a 
menu of commands is displayed.  Below that menu, the prompt 
"command:" is displayed.  The user types the first letter of a 
command, the command executes and the appropriate entry is 
displayed.  Some commands prompt the user for more information.  

The entries are displayed in alphabetical order.  No entry is 
displayed if the phone book is empty.
